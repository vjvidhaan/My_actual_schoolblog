    In addition to the core subject areas of English language arts, math, science, social studies, and the arts, we seek <br>
    to expand each child interests, reasoning, collaboration, and communication skills. Our children learn to take risks<br>

<p>
    Our SAU 70 School Task Force includes more than 30 representatives from multiple employee<br>
     groups as well as medical experts, public health officials, and school board liaisons. <br>
      My sincere thanks to our Task Force members for their ongoing contributions to this enormous undertaking.<br>
     Many of our team members share a personal stake in this important work as parents of students<br>
     in our schools.  In the plan that follows, you will find our attempt to resume public education<br>
      in a way that considers our local context with regard to the pandemic, establishes protocols for <br>
      managing health and safety risks for staff and students, and provides flexibility in the event that<br>

      Music,Physical Education, and Art are 3 specials <br>
      at our school. In art you guess we probably make<br>
      paintings, yes, but we also make things out of clay and<br>
      oragami-(additional). In Physical Education-(P.E.) <br>
      we play many fun games like bonbardment where you<br>
      have to knock the other team's pins down and the first<br>
       to do that wins. And Kick-ball, it's the same thing as<br>
       base-ball except you kick the ball instead of hitting it <br>
       with a bat. And last of all Music. When you get in fourth grade<br>
       you can get to choose a instrument to play. In fifth grade you <br>
       would get to play more difficult instruments if you want. But if <br>
       you're in one of the grades bellow fourth you would get to <br>
       play boom wackers. They're fun to play.

                     Harold Hutchins, living in Piqua, Ohio, and Captain Underpants, an aptly named superhero from one of
                      the boys' homemade comic books, who accidentally ("kinda on purpose") becomes real when George and 
                      Harold hypnotize their ill-tempered principal, Mr. Krupp. Soon after, Mr. Krupp gains superpowers
                      by drinking alien juices in the third book.
